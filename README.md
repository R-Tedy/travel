# Travel App
## Intro
This is a product app for a hiking app. The website is meant to showcase the various features that the app provides and why it is relavant for the prospective client to install and use the app in their hiking journey. The app is made purely with Next.js using typescript as the main scripting language. Major take aways from this project include the use of nested mapping of components by use of childrens in components that are not self closing. It was also a good refresher on the use of Next js in making a responsive website. The site is live. This is the link to check out the works:
